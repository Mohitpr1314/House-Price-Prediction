# House-Price-Prediction
Open the Jupyter Notebook file named House_Price_Prediction.ipynb to run the code.
How to Use
The Jupyter Notebook guides you through the process. You'll do the following:

Load your dataset.
Prepare your data.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Create a simple Linear Regression model.
Train the model.
Make predictions.
Evaluate the model's performance using simple metrics.
Dataset
Replace the '______' file with your own dataset in CSV format. Ensure your dataset has relevant features and a target variable for house prices.

Model
We use a basic Linear Regression model for prediction. You can explore more advanced models for better results.

Evaluation
We assess the model's performance using two basic metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2). You can adapt the metrics to your needs.

Making Predictions
After training the model, you can predict house prices for new data by providing the features for prediction.
